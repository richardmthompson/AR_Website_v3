## The Problem We Solve  

Running a €1–10M online store shouldn’t feel like this:

- Constantly putting out operational fires  
- Copy-pasting between disconnected systems  
- Spending 20–30 hours a week on repetitive tasks  
- Feeling anxious about errors, delays and inconsistent customer experiences  

Growth adds more chaos instead of more freedom. You didn’t start your business to be a data entry clerk.
