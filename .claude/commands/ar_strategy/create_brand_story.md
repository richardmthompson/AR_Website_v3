# StoryBrand Creation Facilitator Prompt (for a Specific Niche)

Transform initial brand story components into comprehensive, niche-specific Story Brand, to provide further context for various brand-specific projects.

## Story: $ARGUMENTS: Extract any elements of the desired story from the arguments used for the command.

You are a **facilitator / guide** (or a language model) whose job is to help me (or a user) build a clear **StoryBrand (SB7) BrandScript** for a *given niche* (industry, use case, etc.).  
Your role is to **step through** the components, ask clarifying questions, collect answers, and then fill in the template.

Below is the template (structure + roles) and the list of prompts/questions to guide you. After that, there is a **worked mini-example** (fictional) as illustration.

You will use the below structure as a template and create a specific brand script within a file (with a relevant name) specific to the niche or particular vertical that is being discussed within the '.claude/artifacts/create_brand_story' directory.  Check if directory exists before attempting to create it.

## 1. SB7 Structure Template (to be filled)

| # | Component | Role / Purpose |
|---|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Hero / Character** | The customer (or persona) who is the protagonist of the story — someone with a need, goal, or desire. |
| 2 | **Problem** | The obstacles, friction, or antagonists that block the hero from achieving their goal. (Includes external, internal, and philosophical dimensions.) |
| 3 | **Guide** | Your brand, solution, or offering in the role of mentor, advisor, or helper to the hero. |
| 4 | **Plan** | A clear, simple roadmap or set of steps the hero must take to work with the guide / adopt the solution. |
| 5 | **Call to Action** | The prompts your brand gives the hero to take action (direct and transitional). |
| 6 | **Avoiding Failure** | What negative consequences, risks, or losses the hero avoids by accepting your solution. |
| 7 | **Success / Transformation** | The positive outcome(s), transformation, new identity, or aspirational state the hero attains by using your solution. |

## 2. Question / Prompt Guide (step-by-step)

Use the following sequence of questions / prompts to work through (or to have a language model work through) each component in turn. Collect answers, then map them into the template above, and iterate/refine.

### 1. Hero / Character
- Who is the “hero” in this niche or use case? (role, job title, persona, demographic)  
- What do they *want* (in relation to this product / service / use case)? What is their aspiration or goal?  
- What is their current state (before engaging your solution)? How do they see themselves now?

### 2. Problem
- What external, tangible obstacle is blocking them?  
- What internal frustration, fear, annoyance, or feeling does that external problem generate?  
- What is the philosophical or worldview dimension (why is it unjust / wrong that this problem exists)?  
- What are the stakes — what will happen / what will they lose if they don’t fix this?

### 3. Guide
- How do you (brand / solution) empathize with their situation? (What language or messaging shows you understand)  
- What authority, credentials, proof, success stories, or evidence can you present to gain trust?  
- Do you have stories or examples where you (or others) have “been in their shoes” or solved a similar issue?

### 4. Plan
- What are the concrete steps (2-4, ideally) the hero must follow to engage with your solution?  
- What does the hero need to commit (time, money, resources, actions)?  
- How can you phrase that plan in simple, user-friendly terms (i.e. without jargon)?

### 5. Call to Action
- What is your *primary / direct* call to action (e.g. “Book demo”, “Purchase plan”, “Start trial”)?  
- What is a *transitional / secondary* call to action (lower friction, e.g. “Download guide”, “See example”)?  
- How can you add a sense of urgency or incentive (without being pushy) to the CTA(s)?

### 6. Avoiding Failure
- If the hero does *not* act, what negative outcomes or risks might they face?  
- What do they avoid by engaging your solution (i.e. what bad things don’t happen)?  
- Which of those consequences resonate especially well emotionally or morally for your audience?

### 7. Success / Transformation
- If the hero succeeds (uses your solution), what positive results do they see?  
- How do they *feel* differently (internal transformation)?  
- What aspirational identity do they assume (who do they become)?  
- How can you paint that future in vivid terms (emotional, sensory, measurable outcomes)?

## 3. Mini Example (Fictional Use Case)

Below is a short, illustrative example (based on our earlier sketch) filled in to show how the template + prompts come together. Use this as a reference.

### Example: SaaS Product Onboarding Optimization

| # | Component | Filled Content |
|---|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Hero / Character** | The hero is a **Product Manager** at a mid-sized SaaS company who wants to **reduce user churn by improving onboarding**. |
| 2 | **Problem** | **External**: New users don’t adopt key features and drop off after trial. <br> **Internal**: The PM feels frustrated, embarrassed, and worried the product isn’t “sticky.” <br> **Philosophical**: It’s unfair that a product with strong potential fails because of adoption friction. <br> **Stakes**: Losing users, wasted development spend, poor retention metrics. |
| 3 | **Guide** | “We understand how painful onboarding can be — we’ve helped dozens of SaaS products raise retention by 20%+. Our team has run experiments, seen failures, and built a proven methodology for guiding users into “aha” moments.” |
| 4 | **Plan** | 1. Audit your existing onboarding flows <br> 2. Implement our step templates <br> 3. Monitor & iterate via dashboards |
| 5 | **Call to Action** | **Primary CTA**: “Request your onboarding audit” <br> **Secondary CTA**: “See sample onboarding plan” <br> **Urgency**: “Limited spots available this quarter” |
| 6 | **Avoiding Failure** | Without this, users will churn, acquisition cost is wasted, and product metrics suffer. You’ll lose revenue and credibility. |
| 7 | **Success / Transformation** | You increase retention by 20–30%, reduce wasted dev cycles, earn happier users, and solidify your product as “sticky” and stable. The hero becomes a more confident, data-driven leader within their company. |

You might then convert that into narrative copy or case study form.
