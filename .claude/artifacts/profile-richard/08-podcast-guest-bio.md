# Richard Thompson - Podcast Guest Bio

## The AI Engineer Who Studied Humans Before Building AI

Richard Thompson builds AI systems with an unusual advantage: he spent two decades formally studying how humans think, learn, and change before writing a single line of production code.

### The Non-Linear Path

After earning a First Class Honours degree in Cognitive Science from the University of Exeter—including an internship at Carnegie Mellon University with legendary cognitive scientist J.L. McClelland—Richard did something unexpected. Instead of immediately pursuing a tech career, he deliberately sought to understand human behavior across radically different contexts:

- Teaching students in Hong Kong
- Consulting for businesses in Sydney
- Coaching fitness clients in London (NVQ Level 4 Personal Training)
- Building furniture as a carpenter in rural Wales
- Earning a Graduate Certificate in NLP, Coaching & Trainer's Training

Each role taught him something crucial about the gap between how systems are supposed to work and how humans actually use them.

### The Return to Programming

After accumulating two decades of wisdom about human psychology and organizational dynamics, Richard returned to his "first love" of programming with 22 months of intensive self-directed study in Kotlin & Android, Python, ML, Voice UX, and Agentic AI.

But now he had a unique advantage: he understood both the technology AND the humans who would use it.

### Current Work: Building AI That Respects Human Intelligence

**At AR Automation**, Richard architects intelligent automation systems for mid-sized organizations. His standout achievement: a "context engineering framework" that achieves 85-95% first-pass completion rates in AI-assisted development—essentially solving the "80% completion problem" that plagues most AI coding attempts.

**VoxManifestor**: Richard's personal project is a voice-first Android app that applies his formal coaching training through sophisticated AI agent architecture. It's essentially a "coaching AI in your pocket" that uses a 4-chain dialogue system to support goal manifestation and behavioral change.

The project demonstrates something unique: Richard isn't just using AI to automate tasks—he's applying cognitive science and coaching psychology to build systems that genuinely support human growth and agency.

### What Makes Richard's Perspective Unique

**Published Researcher**: Co-authored paper in *Developmental Science* (2007) with J.L. McClelland on how children reason about causality

**Formal Coaching Training**: Graduate Certificate in NLP & Coaching—not just "interested in psychology," but professionally trained in behavioral change

**Voice-First Expertise**: Built production voice AI from concept to Alpha launch, implementing complex dialogue systems

**Context Engineering Pioneer**: Created methodology achieving 85-95% success rates in AI-assisted development

**AI Safety Advocate**: Passionate about building AI systems that empower human agency rather than diminishing it

### Great Podcast Topics

- **"From Cognitive Science to Coding: Why Understanding Humans Matters More Than Understanding LLMs"**
- **"Context Engineering: How I Solved the 80% Completion Problem in AI-Assisted Development"**
- **"Building Voice AI That Actually Coaches: Lessons from VoxManifestor"**
- **"The Case Against Specialist AI: Why Generalists Build Better AI Systems"**
- **"AI Safety Through Human-Centered Design: Making AI That Respects Intelligence"**

### The Core Message

Richard's work challenges the assumption that better AI just requires better models. His unique background suggests that understanding how humans actually think, learn, and work might be even more important than understanding the latest transformer architecture.

He's building a career around a simple but radical idea: the best AI systems are built by people who deeply understand both technology and humanity.
