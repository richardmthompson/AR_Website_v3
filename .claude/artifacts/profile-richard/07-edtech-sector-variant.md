# Richard Thompson - EdTech Sector Bio

## AI Engineer Specializing in Educational Technology & Behavioral Psychology

Richard Thompson builds intelligent automation systems for educational institutions, bringing a unique combination of cognitive science research, formal coaching training, and technical expertise in voice-first AI systems.

### Educational Background

Richard's foundation in education begins with his BSc in Cognitive Science (First Class Honours) from the University of Exeter, including an internship at Carnegie Mellon University with Prof. J.L. McClelland—one of the world's leading researchers in how humans learn and process information. Their collaborative research on neural memory modeling, published in *Developmental Science* (2007), explored how children reason about causality—work directly relevant to educational design.

Beyond academic credentials, Richard holds professional certifications:
- **Graduate Certificate in NLP, Coaching & Trainer's Training** (Inspiritive, 2009)
- **NVQ Level 4 Personal Training** (2010) - Professional coaching and behavior change
- **Teaching experience in Hong Kong** - Practical classroom and student support experience

This combination of cognitive science research, formal coaching training, and hands-on teaching experience gives Richard a deep understanding of how students learn, what barriers they face, and how technology can genuinely support educational outcomes.

### EdTech Expertise at AR Automation

At AR Automation, Richard specializes in building automation solutions for educational institutions:

**Multilingual Student Support**: Develops AI agents supporting 50+ languages for international student services, reducing registration time from 3+ hours to 15 minutes (88% reduction)

**Administrative Automation**: Creates systems that automate accreditation workflows, document processing, and cross-campus coordination—helping institutions reduce administrative overhead by 30-40%

**Voice-First Interfaces**: Designs conversational AI systems that make complex administrative processes accessible through natural voice interaction

**Behavioral Psychology Integration**: Applies formal coaching methodologies to design student support systems that don't just process information, but genuinely help students succeed

### VoxManifestor: Educational Psychology Through AI

Richard's personal project, VoxManifestor, demonstrates his unique approach to applying educational and behavioral psychology through technology:

- **Voice-first goal-setting system** helping users articulate and work toward educational and personal goals
- **Coaching conversation strategies** implementing formal NLP/coaching techniques through AI
- **Manifestation psychology** helping students contrast their current state with desired outcomes and create actionable pathways
- **Behavioral change support** through structured reflection and affirmation processes

This project shows how Richard's formal training in coaching and cognitive science translates into practical tools that support human growth and achievement.

### Why EdTech Institutions Choose Richard

**Understands Learning**: Published research on how humans reason and learn, not just technical implementation

**Formal Coaching Training**: Graduate Certificate in NLP & Coaching provides frameworks for supporting student success

**Multilingual Capabilities**: Native support for 50+ languages enables truly international operations

**Automation with Human Touch**: Designs systems that reduce administrative burden while enhancing student support quality

**Proven Results**: AR Automation's EdTech work shows 88% time reduction in student registration, 85% faster accreditation prep, 30-40% admin cost reduction
