Summary
I design and build AI-powered applications for businesses who want
to automate the boring stuff and focus on the things that make them
more successful and happy.
I design voice agents that listen and respond, with conversational
interfaces that keep the conversation going. They help users be
more proactive, to help users express themselves, think more
clearly, set goals, to plan and focus their productive energy.
I've had careers in numerous industries. I graduated from Exeter
University with a First Class Honours Degree in Cognitive Science
20 years ago and was privileged to work with legendary cognitive
scientist J. McClelland at that time. I wrote my first language model
in 2004 as a final year project.
Since then I gained experience in Education and Tutoring in Hong
Kong, and Business Consulting in Sydney, Australia. Later, I
became a Trainer of Physical Fitness, coaching clients towards
health and longevity in London, UK. I then temporarily retired from
the City to the Welsh Countryside, as a Carpenter and Joiner,
building structures, furniture, camper vans and cabins.
With a BSc in Cognitive Science and 22 months of dedicated self-
study in AI, Language Models, Agentic and Automation Frameworks
and Android development, I’ve built working apps, learned Kotlin,
Python, LLM and Prompt / Context Engineering, Software and AI
Engineering, and rediscovered the spark that led me to programming
originally, as a teenager (you could say that programming was my
first love).
I've come full circle, and have finally arrived.
I'm here to Engineer A.I. and chew bubble gum, and I'm all outta
bubble gum.
