# Richard Thompson - Comprehensive Professional Bio

Richard Thompson is an AI Engineer and automation consultant who builds intelligent systems at the intersection of cognitive science, behavioral psychology, and technical implementation. His work is guided by a singular focus: creating technology that empowers human agency and growth, rather than diminishing it.

## Educational Foundation

Richard's journey began with a BSc in Cognitive Science (First Class Honours) from the University of Exeter, including an internship at Carnegie Mellon University with Prof. J.L. McClelland—one of the founders of connectionist cognitive science. This collaboration resulted in a co-authored paper on neural memory modeling published in *Developmental Science* (2007), exploring how children reason about causality through connectionist models.

This academic foundation in how humans actually think and learn has shaped everything that followed. Rather than immediately pursuing a traditional tech career, Richard deliberately sought to understand human behavior across diverse contexts:

- **Graduate Certificate in NLP, Coaching & Trainer's Training** (Inspiritive, Sydney, 2009) - Formal training in conversational coaching and behavioral change methodologies
- **NVQ Level 4 Personal Training** (Premier Training, London, 2010) - Professional qualification in fitness coaching and human performance
- **NVQ Level 2 Carpentry & Joinery** (Able Skills, London, 2016) - Hands-on craftsmanship and practical problem-solving
- **Social Entrepreneurs Startup Programme** (School for Social Entrepreneurs, 2019) - Business strategy and social impact

After two decades of accumulated wisdom about how people work, think, and change, Richard returned to his "first love" of programming with **22 months of intensive self-directed study** (2023-2025) in Kotlin & Android, Python, ML, Voice UX, Agentic AI, Conversational AI Engineering, and Prompt/Context Engineering for LLMs.

## Current Work

### AR Automation

At **AR Automation**, Richard architects intelligent systems helping mid-sized organizations eliminate repetitive work and scale operations. He built the company's full-stack web platform (React + FastAPI + LangGraph), developed multilingual AI chatbots for lead qualification, and created a sophisticated **context engineering framework** that enables AI-assisted development to achieve 85-95% first-pass completion rates—transforming ad-hoc prompting into systematic, production-ready workflows.

### VoxManifestor

In parallel, Richard designed and built **VoxManifestor**, a voice-first Android app that applies his formal coaching training through sophisticated AI agent architecture. This production mobile application implements:

- **4-chain dialogue architecture** combining transition evaluation, theme extraction, strategy selection, and response generation
- **10 coaching conversation strategies** (rapport building, emotional validation, reflective mirroring, etc.) drawn from NLP/coaching certification
- **Manifestation psychology integration** helping users define goals, contrast present vs. desired states, and create actionable pathways
- **Voice-first interaction patterns** with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and TTS
- **Complex state management** using hierarchical state machines and MVVM patterns
- **Modular agent systems** (successfully refactored from 3000 to 1849 lines through architectural excellence)

## Technical Expertise

- **AI Agent Architecture**: LangGraph, multi-chain dialogue systems, prompt engineering, conversation state machines
- **Full-Stack Development**: Python/FastAPI, React/TypeScript, native Android (Kotlin), PostgreSQL, Docker
- **Mobile Development**: Jetpack Compose, Room Database, StateFlow/Flow patterns, voice-first UX
- **Behavioral Psychology**: NLP coaching techniques, manifestation methodology, behavioral change frameworks
- **System Integration**: n8n workflows, Google Cloud APIs, OpenAI/Gemini, multilingual automation
- **Methodologies**: Context engineering, MVVM architecture, modular refactoring, documentation-first development

## Core Values

Richard's work is guided by deep interest in **AI safety, cognitive realism, and user-centered design**. He believes technology should respect human intelligence and amplify strategic value—not reduce skilled professionals to data entry and system-switching. His diverse background enables him to ask the crucial question: "Will this actually help people, or just add complexity?"

As AR Automation expands its consulting services for e-commerce, accounting, and educational institutions, Richard is evolving from pure engineering into a consulting role—helping organizations design and implement automation strategies that deliver measurable ROI while genuinely supporting human agency and growth.
