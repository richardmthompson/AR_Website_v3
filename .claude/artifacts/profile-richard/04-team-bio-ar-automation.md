# Richard Thompson - AR Automation Team Bio

## AI Engineer, Automation Architect & Cognitive Science Researcher

Richard designs and builds the intelligent systems that power AR Automation's client solutions—from web platforms to voice-driven mobile applications. With a background in Cognitive Science (First Class Honours, University of Exeter) including research collaboration with Prof. J.L. McClelland at Carnegie Mellon University, he brings both rigorous academic training and practical understanding of how organizations actually work.

Richard's published research on neural memory modeling (*Developmental Science*, 2007) explored how humans reason about causality—work that continues to inform how he designs AI systems today. Beyond academic credentials, he holds professional certifications in coaching (Graduate Certificate in NLP & Coaching, Inspiritive Sydney) and personal training (NVQ Level 4), giving him formal training in behavioral change methodologies that most AI engineers lack.

Before returning to AI and software development, Richard's career deliberately spanned diverse contexts: teaching in Hong Kong, business consulting in Sydney, fitness coaching in London, and carpentry in Wales. This wasn't career wandering—it was strategic knowledge accumulation. Each role taught him how people work, what causes technology adoption failures, and what drives genuine operational transformation.

At AR Automation, Richard architects agentic AI systems using LangGraph, builds full-stack web applications, develops voice-first conversational interfaces, and creates the context engineering methodologies that enable rapid, reliable implementation. He specializes in multilingual AI agents, system integration, and creating automation infrastructure that works with clients' existing tech stacks—not replacing them.

Beyond AR Automation's client work, Richard designed and built VoxManifestor, a voice-first Android app that applies his formal coaching training through sophisticated AI agent architecture. This project demonstrates his unique ability to bridge behavioral psychology with technical implementation—building systems that don't just process information, but genuinely support human behavior change and goal achievement.

Richard's context engineering framework has achieved 85-95% first-pass completion rates in AI-assisted development, transforming how AR Automation builds client solutions. His work is guided by deep interest in AI safety, cognitive realism, and user-centered design—building technology that empowers human agency rather than diminishing it.

As AR Automation grows, Richard is expanding from pure implementation into consulting, helping organizations design automation strategies that deliver measurable ROI while genuinely supporting their teams' growth and capabilities.
