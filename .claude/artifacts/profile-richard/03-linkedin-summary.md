# Richard Thompson - LinkedIn Summary

I build AI systems that genuinely support human agency and growth—because I've spent two decades formally studying and practicing how humans think, learn, and change.

## Academic Foundation

My journey started at University of Exeter with a First Class Honours degree in Cognitive Science, including an internship at Carnegie Mellon University with Prof. J.L. McClelland (one of the founders of connectionist cognitive science). We co-authored research on neural memory modeling published in *Developmental Science* (2007), exploring how children reason about causality.

But I didn't stop there. I deliberately pursued diverse training to understand human behavior from multiple angles:
- **Graduate Certificate in NLP, Coaching & Trainer's Training** (2009) - Formal training in conversational coaching
- **NVQ Level 4 Personal Training** (2010) - Professional coaching qualification
- **Social Entrepreneurs Startup Programme** (2019) - Business and impact thinking

After 20 years of learning how people actually work—teaching in Hong Kong, consulting in Sydney, coaching fitness clients in London, building furniture as a carpenter in Wales—I returned to programming with accumulated wisdom about human psychology and organizational dynamics.

## Technical Journey

22 months of intensive self-directed study (2023-2025) in Kotlin & Android, Python, ML, Voice UX, Agentic AI, and Prompt/Context Engineering brought me back to my "first love" of software development, but now with a unique advantage: I understand both the technology AND the humans who use it.

## Current Projects

### AR Automation

I architect agentic AI workflows using LangGraph, build full-stack platforms (React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL), and develop multilingual AI agents for customer service, lead qualification, and knowledge management. I created a **context engineering framework** that achieves 85-95% first-pass completion rates in AI-assisted development—essentially solving the "80% completion problem" that plagues most AI coding attempts.

### VoxManifestor

I designed and built **VoxManifestor**, a voice-first Android app that applies my formal coaching training through sophisticated AI agent architecture. The app uses a **4-chain dialogue system** with Google Gemini to facilitate voice journaling, goal manifestation, and behavioral change—essentially a "coaching AI in your pocket" that implements the NLP/coaching methodologies I learned formally.

## What I Do

- Design sophisticated AI agent architectures (multi-chain dialogue systems, conversation state machines)
- Build full-stack web platforms and native mobile applications
- Create methodologies and frameworks (context engineering, modular agent systems)
- Apply behavioral psychology and coaching principles through software (backed by formal NLP/coaching certification)
- Integrate voice-first conversational interfaces with LLM intelligence
- Refactor and improve complex systems (reduced 3000-line agent to 1849 lines through modular architecture)

I'm particularly proud of our approach at AR Automation: we don't ask clients to rip out their existing systems. We build intelligent layers that connect fragmented tools, automate repetitive workflows, and empower teams to scale without proportional headcount increases.

## Core Values

My work is guided by deep interest in **AI safety, cognitive realism, and user-centered design**. I believe talented professionals deserve tools that respect their intelligence and amplify their strategic value—not reduce them to data entry clerks.

As AR Automation grows, I'm evolving from pure engineering into consulting—helping organizations design and implement automation strategies that deliver measurable ROI while genuinely supporting human agency and growth.
