# Richard Thompson - Technical Conference Bio

## AI Engineer, Context Engineering Researcher & Published Cognitive Scientist

Richard Thompson builds sophisticated AI agent architectures and pioneers methodologies for reliable AI-assisted development. His work bridges cognitive science, software engineering, and behavioral psychology to create systems that genuinely understand and support human needs.

## Academic Background

BSc Cognitive Science, First Class Honours (University of Exeter). Internship at Carnegie Mellon University with Prof. J.L. McClelland, resulting in co-authored publication on neural memory modeling in *Developmental Science* (2007). Graduate Certificate in NLP, Coaching & Trainer's Training (Inspiritive, 2009).

## Notable Technical Work

### Context Engineering Framework
Developed systematic approach to AI-assisted development achieving 85-95% first-pass completion rates through Product Requirement Prompts (PRPs), specialized slash commands, and multi-level validation loops

### Multi-Chain Dialogue Systems
Architected 4-chain conversation processing for voice-first AI agents, combining transition evaluation, theme extraction, strategy selection, and response generation

### VoxManifestor
Production Android app implementing formal coaching methodologies through AI agent architecture with voice-first interaction patterns

### Modular Agent Refactoring
Successfully decomposed monolithic agent system (3000 lines) into maintainable modular architecture (1849 lines) through specialized managers and function-based patterns

## Technical Contributions

- Agentic AI systems using LangGraph and modern LLM orchestration
- Voice-first mobile applications with Google Cloud Speech APIs
- Context engineering methodologies for AI-assisted development
- Hierarchical state machines for complex conversation management
