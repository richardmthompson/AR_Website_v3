#### The Value-First Approach
*"I have some insights on [topic] that might be relevant to [their company/project]. No agenda - just thought it might be valuable to share. Would you have 10 minutes for coffee?"*

### Segment-Specific Conversation Starters

#### For EdTech Company Founders/Executives:

**Opening:**
*"What's your biggest operational bottleneck right now as you scale? Customer onboarding? System integrations? Data workflows?"*

**Follow-Up Based on Response:**

If **Customer Onboarding:**
*"How long does it take you to onboard a new school or district? We helped [EdTech company] go from 4 weeks to 48 hours by automating their setup workflows. I can walk you through the approach."*

If **System Integrations:**
*"Which LMS/SIS platforms do you integrate with? We've built pre-configured connectors for 50+ platforms that handle the entire integration and sync process automatically. Happy to show you the architecture."*

If **Evidence/Impact Data:**
*"Are you collecting usage and outcomes data systematically? We automate the entire impact evidence pipeline - from data collection to report generation. Several EdTech companies use it to prove efficacy for school buyers."*

If **AI Integration:**
*"How are you approaching AI integration? Are you building in-house or using APIs? We've built infrastructure that lets EdTech companies integrate LLMs safely with compliance and monitoring built-in. Would love to compare notes."*

**Discovery Questions:**
1. "What's holding you back from scaling faster?"
2. "Where do you spend the most manual effort in operations?"
3. "If you could automate one workflow tomorrow, what would it be?"
4. "What's your approach to integrating with school IT systems?"
5. "How do you collect and report impact data for schools?"

**Positioning Statement:**
*"We build the operational infrastructure that EdTech companies need but don't have resources to build themselves. Think of us as your automation engineering team on demand. We've helped companies like [examples] scale 5-10x without proportional cost increases by automating onboarding, integrations, and data workflows."*

#### For Assessment & Testing Organizations:

**Opening:**
*"How are you approaching AI-assisted evaluation? Are you using hybrid models (AI + human review) or fully automated scoring?"*

**Follow-Up Based on Response:**

If **Scaling Assessment:**
*"What's limiting your ability to scale? Evaluator availability? Quality consistency? We've built workflow automation that lets assessment organizations handle 10x volume without hiring proportionally. Can show you a demo."*

If **Portfolio Assessment:**
*"Portfolio and performance assessment is complex to scale. We've automated the entire workflow - collection, organization, rubric application, and evaluation. One client went from weeks per cohort to days."*

If **Language Testing:**

### Handling Common Objections

#### "We're already working on building this internally"

**Response:**
*"That's great - having internal ownership is valuable. A few questions: How far along are you? What's the timeline? And who's dedicating time to it?"*

[Usually reveals that internal build is stalled or low-priority]

*"We've found that even companies with strong engineering teams benefit from our pre-built infrastructure because it lets your team focus on your core product instead of operational workflows. We're not replacing your team - we're augmenting them. Think of it like using AWS instead of building your own servers."*

#### "We don't have budget for this right now"

**Response:**
*"Totally understand - budgets are tight. A few questions: What's the cost of the current manual process? How much staff time? What's the opportunity cost of not scaling?"*

[Calculate ROI on the spot]

*"Our clients typically see 5-10x ROI in the first year because of staff time savings and ability to scale without hiring. Also, we can structure this as a pilot to de-risk - 30-60 days, focused on one high-pain workflow, at a fraction of full cost. Once you see the results, we can discuss broader engagement."*

#### "This sounds complex - we don't have bandwidth for implementation"

**Response:**
*"That's exactly why we built this the way we did. Our implementation is low-friction on your side - typically 2-3 hours of your team's time for initial scoping, then we handle the build and integration. We don't require months of internal project management."*

*"We can start with one specific workflow - maybe customer onboarding or data collection - show results in 30 days, then expand. You don't need to boil the ocean on day one."*

#### "We need to see proof this works for organizations like ours"

**Response:**
*"Absolutely - I'd never expect you to take a leap of faith. Let me share [specific case study most relevant to their situation]. And if it makes sense, we can do a proof-of-concept pilot focused on your specific use case. Low cost, clear success metrics, no long-term commitment required."*

#### "We're concerned about data security and compliance"

**Response:**
*"That's a critical concern, especially in education. Security and compliance are built into our architecture from day one - not bolted on. We support local deployment if you need data to stay on your infrastructure. We're SOC 2 compliant [if true], and we've worked with institutions subject to FERPA, GDPR, and regional regulations."*

*"For your specific compliance needs, we'd do a security review during scoping and architect the solution to meet your requirements. We can also provide full audit trails and documentation for regulators."*
