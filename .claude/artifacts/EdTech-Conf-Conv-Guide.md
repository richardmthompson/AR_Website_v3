# EdTech Conference: Quick Conversation Guide
## Front-of-Mind Value Propositions

---

## Your Opener

**"I'm an AI engineer. We architect and build AI agents to solve operational bottlenecks for education organizations."**

**"Two categories: Basic functions like onboarding automation and customer service chatbots. More complex: document processing, multilingual systems, and judgment-involving workflows."**

**"With recent agentic AI advances, a lot of information processing that only humans could do until recently doesn't make sense for humans anymore."**

## How to Pitch (Vary by Audience)

### To EdTech Companies (CEOs, COOs)
**Focus:** "Scale without scaling headcount"
**Pitch:** "At 300% growth, customer onboarding is your bottleneck. We automate 70% of it - 6 weeks becomes 1 week. Your team focuses on relationships, not technical plumbing."
**Key metric:** Scale 3x-4x without 3x-4x headcount

---

### To School Networks (Multi-campus operators)
**Focus:** "Operations across campuses on autopilot"
**Pitch:** "Parent inquiries take 2 days? We make it 5 minutes with multilingual AI. Admin cost per student drops 30-40%. Scale to more campuses without proportional admin growth."
**Key metric:** Admin cost per student “ 30-40%

---

### To Universities (Admissions, Operations)
**Focus:** "Student experience + staff efficiency"
**Pitch:** "International student registration takes 3 hours? We make it 15 minutes with multilingual AI. Students love it, staff have 50% more time for complex work."
**Key metric:** 3 hours ’ 15 minutes per student

---

### To VCs/Investors (Portfolio support)
**Focus:** "Portfolio companies waste 30-40% of engineering on operational plumbing"
**Pitch:** "We provide operational infrastructure as a service - onboarding, integrations, compliance. Portfolio companies focus 100% on product. Better unit economics = higher valuations."
**Key metric:** 30-40% engineering time freed up

---

## The Core Differentiator

**Not:** Another consulting firm (strategy but no implementation)
**Not:** A SaaS product (doesn't integrate with existing systems)
**Not:** A dev shop (builds custom code, expensive)

**We Are:** Operational infrastructure-as-a-service
- Pre-built AI agents for education use cases
- Pre-built integrations for education systems (SIS, LMS, CRM, etc.)
- Rapid deployment (30-60 days)
- Ongoing management included

---

## Questions to Ask (Qualify Leads)

1. **"What's your biggest operational bottleneck right now?"**
   ’ Listen for: onboarding, support, document processing, scaling challenges

2. **"How much time does [specific workflow] take?"**
   ’ Quantify pain, calculate ROI potential

3. **"What systems do you currently use?"**
   ’ Assess integration complexity (SIS, LMS, CRM, etc.)

4. **"What's your timeline for solving this?"**
   ’ Qualify: 0-3 months = hot, 3-6 months = warm, 6+ months = cool

5. **"Who else should I talk to on your team?"**
   ’ Expand relationships, identify decision-makers

## Red Flags to Avoid Saying

L "We can solve any problem" (too broad)
L "Our AI is the smartest" (not differentiated)
L "You'll never need humans" (threatening, untrue)
L "Implementation is easy" (undermines complexity)

---

## Green Lights to Always Say

 "We specialize in education operations"
 "Our AI is trained on education documents and workflows"
 "AI handles repetitive work, humans focus on complex decisions"
 "We start with 30-day pilot on ONE high-pain workflow"
 "You don't need AI engineers on staff"
 "Works with your existing systems"

---

## Follow-Up Actions

**After good conversation:**
1. Get business card
2. Log in CRM immediately (mobile)
3. Ask: "Can we schedule 30 minutes next week to dig deeper?"
4. Send one-pager within 48 hours
5. Connect on LinkedIn

**Lead tiers:**
- **Hot (Tier A):** Decision-maker + clear pain + budget + 0-3 month timeline ’ Discovery call within 1 week
- **Warm (Tier B):** Influencer + pain identified + 3-6 month timeline ’ One-pager + call within 2 weeks
- **Cool (Tier C):** Explorer + unclear pain + 6+ months ’ Newsletter + occasional check-ins

## Quick Technical Q&A

**"How does it integrate with our systems?"**
’ "API integrations (REST, GraphQL), database connections, or file-based. We have pre-built connectors for PowerSchool, Canvas, Salesforce, etc. Usually 80% uses existing connectors, 20% custom."

**"What about data security?"**
’ "Three options: Cloud (SOC 2 compliant), VPC (your cloud account), or on-premises (your servers). For student data, we recommend VPC/on-prem for FERPA compliance. We never train on your data."

**"What if AI makes mistakes?"**
’ "Three safety layers: Human-in-the-loop for high-stakes decisions, confidence thresholds (AI only acts at 90%+ confidence), full audit trails. Example: AI extracts data, human makes final admission decision."

**"How long to implement?"**
’ "30-60 day pilot on ONE workflow. You see value fast. Then expand 2-3 more workflows over next 60-90 days. No big bang launches."

**"What's the cost?"**
’ "Implementation: $30k-150k. Platform subscription: $3k-20k/month. Example: $60k implementation + $6k/month = $132k year 1, $72k ongoing. ROI is typically 10x-20x."

---

## Closing Statement

**"Here's what I'd suggest: Let's schedule 30 minutes next week. I'll show you exactly how we'd automate [their specific pain point]. You'll see a live demo of the workflow, and we can discuss if it makes sense to do a 30-day pilot. Sound good?"**
