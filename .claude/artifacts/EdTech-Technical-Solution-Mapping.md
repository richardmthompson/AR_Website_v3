# EdTech Conference: Technical Solution Mapping
## Agentic AI + n8n Automation → Concrete EdTech Solutions

**AR Automation | Technical Capability → Use Case Translation**
**Prepared:** October 11, 2025
**Purpose:** Map our technical capabilities to demo-ready, prospect-specific solutions

---

## Part 1: Core Technical Capabilities

### What We Actually Build With

#### Capability A: Agentic AI (LangGraph + OpenAI)
**What It Is:**
- AI agents that autonomously execute multi-step workflows
- Conversational AI that can understand context, make decisions, and take actions
- Document processing AI that can read, extract, validate, and route information
- Stateful agents that maintain context across long workflows

**Technical Stack:**
- LangGraph for agent orchestration
- OpenAI GPT-4 for language understanding
- LangChain for tool integration
- PostgreSQL for state management

**What It's Good For:**
- Complex decision-making workflows
- Natural language interfaces (chatbots, voice assistants)
- Document understanding and processing
- Multilingual operations
- Context-aware automation

#### Capability B: n8n Workflow Automation
**What It Is:**
- Visual workflow builder for connecting systems
- Self-hostable integration platform
- 400+ pre-built integrations (Salesforce, Slack, Google Workspace, etc.)
- Custom API integrations
- Schedule-based and trigger-based automation

**Technical Stack:**
- n8n workflow engine
- Custom nodes for specialized integrations
- Webhook triggers
- Database connectors (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)

**What It's Good For:**
- System integration (connecting legacy systems, SaaS tools, databases)
- Data synchronization across platforms
- Scheduled tasks and batch processing
- Event-driven automation
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations

#### Capability C: The Combined Power
**Why This Combination Is Unique:**
- **n8n handles system integration** → connects all their existing tools
- **Agentic AI handles intelligence** → makes decisions, processes documents, communicates
- **Together:** Intelligent automation that works with existing infrastructure

**Example:**
1. n8n pulls application documents from university's admissions system
2. Agentic AI reviews documents, extracts information, validates completeness
3. AI agent communicates with applicant via email/chat to request missing items
4. n8n updates CRM with application status
5. AI agent routes to appropriate admissions officer based on program/criteria
6. n8n sends notifications to all stakeholders

This is **impossible with n8n alone** (no intelligence) or **AI alone** (no system integration).

## Part 7: Technical Deep-Dive Questions & Answers

### Expected Technical Questions

**Q: "How does this integrate with our existing systems?"**

A: "Three layers of integration:

1. **API Integration (preferred):** If your system has an API, n8n connects directly. We support REST, GraphQL, SOAP, webhooks.

2. **Database Integration:** If no API, we can connect directly to your database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle) with read/write access.

3. **File/Email Integration:** If neither API nor DB access, we can work with file exports or email-based workflows.

Most EdTech companies have APIs for their major systems. We've built integrations for:
- SIS: PowerSchool, Ellucian, Infinite Campus, etc.
- LMS: Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle
- CRM: Salesforce, HubSpot
- Payment: Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal

For your specific systems, we'd assess in discovery phase. Usually 80% of integrations use existing n8n connectors, 20% require custom work."

---

**Q: "What about data security and privacy?"**

A: "Three deployment models:

1. **Cloud Hosted (our infrastructure):**
   - AWS/Azure hosting
   - SOC 2 Type II compliant
   - Encryption at rest and transit
   - Data residency options (US, EU, Asia)

2. **VPC Deployment (your cloud):**
   - Runs in your AWS/Azure account
   - You control network, access, data
   - We provide deployment templates and support

3. **On-Premises (your servers):**
   - For highly sensitive data (PII, FERPA-sensitive)
   - You control everything
   - We provide installation, configuration, support

For education clients handling student data, we typically recommend VPC or on-premises to ensure FERPA compliance. We never train models on your data. Your data stays in your environment."

---

**Q: "What if the AI makes a mistake?"**

A: "Three layers of safety:

1. **Human-in-the-Loop Workflows:**
   - High-stakes decisions (admissions, financial aid) always route to humans
   - AI provides recommendation + supporting data
   - Human reviews and approves

2. **Confidence Thresholds:**
   - AI only acts autonomously when confidence > 90%
   - Low-confidence cases automatically escalate to humans
   - You configure thresholds per workflow

3. **Audit Trails:**
   - Every AI decision is logged
   - Full transparency on what data was used
   - Ability to review and override

Example: Student application processing
- AI extracts data from documents (high confidence)
- AI routes to appropriate admissions officer (medium confidence)
- Human makes final admission decision (always)

For customer-facing AI (chatbots), we implement:
- Guardrails (what the AI can/cannot say)
- Escalation triggers ('I'm not sure, let me connect you to a human')
- Feedback loops (humans review conversations, AI improves)"

---

**Q: "How long does implementation take?"**

A: "Phased approach:

**Phase 1: Pilot (30-60 days)**
- Pick ONE high-pain workflow
- Map current process
- Build automation
- Test with real users
- Iterate based on feedback
- Go live

**Phase 2: Expand (60-90 days)**
- Add 2-3 more workflows
- Integrate additional systems
- Scale to more users
- Training and change management

**Phase 3: Scale (Ongoing)**
- Add workflows incrementally
- Continuous optimization
- User feedback integration

Most clients see value within 30 days (pilot). Full implementation for complex organizations: 6-12 months.

We don't do 'big bang' launches. Incremental deployment reduces risk and allows learning."

---

**Q: "What's the cost model?"**

A: "Three components:

1. **Implementation (one-time):**
   - Discovery and process mapping
   - Custom AI agent development
   - n8n workflow configuration
   - Integration setup
   - Training
   - Typical range: $30k-150k depending on complexity

2. **Platform (monthly/annual subscription):**
   - AI agent hosting and management
   - n8n workflow execution
   - System integrations
   - Updates and improvements
   - Typical range: $3k-20k/month based on scale

3. **Support (included or optional premium):**
   - Standard: email/chat support, 48hr response
   - Premium: dedicated success manager, 4hr response, custom development
   - Typical range: included to $3k/month

Example pricing for mid-size EdTech company (10,000 users):
- Implementation: $60k
- Platform: $6k/month ($72k/year)
- Support: Included
- Year 1 total: $132k
- Ongoing: $72k/year

ROI is typically 10x-20x (you save $1M in operational costs, invest $100k)."

---

**Q: "Can we build this ourselves?"**

A: "Yes, you could. Here's the build vs. buy analysis:

**Build In-House:**
- Hire AI engineers (2-3): $400k-600k/year
- Hire integration engineers (2): $250k-350k/year
- Infrastructure costs: $50k/year
- Time to first value: 12-18 months
- Ongoing maintenance: same team, perpetually
- Total 3-year cost: $2M-3M

**Buy from AR Automation:**
- Implementation: $60k-150k
- Ongoing: $70k-100k/year
- Time to first value: 30-60 days
- Maintenance: included
- Total 3-year cost: $300k-450k

**Savings: $1.5M-2.5M over 3 years**

Plus: Your engineering team focuses on your core product, not operational infrastructure.

Most companies find it's not worth building this in-house unless operational automation IS your core business."

## Part 9: Key Takeaways for Conference Team

### What We Actually Sell

**Not:** "AI and automation" (too generic)

**Instead:**
- "Multilingual student registration that takes 15 minutes instead of 3 hours"
- "EdTech customer onboarding that takes 1 week instead of 6 weeks"
- "School operations that scale 3x without 3x headcount"
- "Accreditation preparation that takes weeks instead of months"

**Always specific, always outcome-focused.**

### The Core Message

"We provide operational infrastructure for education organizations. AI agents handle intelligence (understanding documents, conversations, decisions). n8n handles integration (connecting your existing systems). Together, you get automation that actually works with your current setup.

You don't need AI engineers on staff. You don't need to rip and replace systems. You start with one high-pain workflow, see results in 30 days, and expand from there."

### What Makes Us Different

**Not:** Another consulting firm that does strategy
**Not:** A SaaS product that doesn't integrate with your systems
**Not:** A development shop that builds custom code

**We Are:** Infrastructure-as-a-service for education operations
- Pre-built AI agents for education use cases
- Pre-built integrations for education systems
- Rapid deployment (30-60 days)
- Ongoing management and optimization

### Red Flags to Avoid

**Don't say:**
- "We can solve any problem" (too broad)
- "Our AI is the smartest" (not differentiated)
- "You'll never need humans" (threatening, untrue)
- "Implementation is easy" (undermines complexity)

**Do say:**
- "We specialize in education operations"
- "Our AI is trained on education documents and workflows"
- "AI handles repetitive work, humans focus on complex decisions"
- "Implementation is structured: 30-day pilot, then expand"
