* Spoke to Sheinal Bhuralal, Co-FOunder


## 3 issues

1. Integrating inbound enquiries into hubspot: receive inbound enquiries in whatsapp and integrate in Hubspot to be able to track what's occuring:
    * Could be multilingual : Singaporean, Malaysian, etc.
    -> Discussed APIs and what connects 

2. Tracking what point of the sales pipeline different prospects are at, what is the next action that needs to be done, keeping track of this information and being able to report about what has been said up until that point and how to break through to next stage of pipeline.

3. Response quality to potential prospects / parents is very poor - seen by going into the sales rep's phone and looking at what's been sent in whatsapp.  How to improve - have agent give responses - basic agentic customer support.


## Summary: Two basic implementations

### Sales qualification and pipeline management bot

### Customer service response bot

> From what I can understand, Michael's organization manages I believe he has some software infrastructure which manages ed tech products for networks of schools. We spoke about the importance of effectively managing subscriptions for ed tech products, of which any given school may have up to a hundred of.

> He mentioned the issue whereby staff at schools may not be aware of all of the available tools that his platform makes available for them. I explained that an agent or chatbot could help to maintain and educate about, or provide documentation for, the gamut of products which are available to the staff in the schools that he provides for. 

> I spoke of the concept that an agent, and agents generally, are very good at summarizing, concatenating, and simplifying information from potentially complex sources. Coupled with their ability to use tools and access those tools through APIs, they can potentially simplify and automate certain processes, which can save administrative burden. 

> Looking at his website, it seems to be a classic example of a situation where there is an awful lot of information that people could be finding but that are likely not finding because of the complexity and the lack of sophistication of a simple search function. So even just the selecting of a particularly useful EdTech product could likely be simplified by formulating an interface, a chatbot interface on the search on his website. 

> I explained the concept of describing the organisation and its operational processes as a flow chart, and then representing that in terms of information flow. Having an agent take over parts of those or components of that flow chart, starting with small elements and then gradually increasing the scope. I also mentioned the concept of oversight and of being able to view the logs of the agent to understand exactly what types of things it was doing. And outlined a potential scenario where an agent was managing subscriptions and cancellations and was managing communication with the relevant staff member, and then using rules for escalation in the case that the staff member was unresponsive. Thereby using gradually more creative solutions in order to obtain its ultimate goal, which was the managing of subscriptions. 


> Michael expressed his interest in potentially having us design a small solution for something that had immediate value. He also asked if we could provide evidence of previous work done, asked for a ballpark figure or price range, and seemed keen to have us work for him.

Edward lives in Bangkok and mentioned that he works for a Bangkok-based university. He expressed an interest in a customer service chatbot for students, which would also be used by the staff â€“ although he mentioned that last element jokingly. And is keen to talk to us about a chatbot.
