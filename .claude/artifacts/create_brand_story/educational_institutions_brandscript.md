## 2. Problem

### External Problem (The Visible Obstacle)
- **Student Registration Inefficiency**: Taking hours of staff time per international student to manually process multilingual registration forms
- **Fragmented Systems**: Ad-hoc solutions built by freelancers that don't integrate, creating data silos across departments
- **Knowledge Management Chaos**: Important documents scattered across systems, with no centralized, secure access for staff or students
- **Accreditation Burden**: Government certification applications and renewals requiring extensive manual form completion, taking weeks or months to complete
- **Document Processing Overload**: Massive volumes of administrative paperwork consuming staff time that could be spent on student support

### Internal Problem (The Frustration)
- **Feeling Overwhelmed**: "We're spending more time on paperwork than helping students"
- **Embarrassment**: "We pride ourselves on being a modern institution, but our processes are stuck in the past"
- **Anxiety**: "With enrollment dropping 15% by 2029, we can't afford to keep hiring more administrative staff"
- **Guilt**: "International students choose us for quality education, but their first experience is a frustrating 3-hour registration process"
- **Exhaustion**: "Every accreditation cycle feels like we're reinventing the wheel"

### Philosophical Problem (Why It's Unjust)
It's fundamentally wrong that educational institutions—which exist to advance knowledge and serve students—are being crushed by administrative processes. Education should be about learning and growth, not bureaucratic burden.

When 85% administrative position growth (1975-2005) outpaces actual educational delivery, something is broken. Students and faculty deserve better. Staff deserve to do meaningful work, not repetitive data entry.

### Stakes (What Happens If They Don't Act)
- **Financial Crisis**: Administrative costs continue rising while enrollment drops 15%, creating an unsustainable cost structure
- **Student Experience Decline**: International students choose competitors with better onboarding experiences
- **Compliance Risk**: Manual accreditation processes lead to errors, missed deadlines, or failed renewals
- **Staff Burnout**: High turnover in administrative roles due to repetitive, unfulfilling work
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Other institutions modernize while they fall behind
- **Data Security Breaches**: Fragmented systems and poor document management increase privacy violation risks under FERPA
