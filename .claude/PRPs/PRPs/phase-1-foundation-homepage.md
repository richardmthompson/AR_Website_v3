name: "AR Automation Website - Phase 1: Foundation & Homepage"
description: "Build the design system, component library, and complete English homepage for AR Automation marketing website using Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and static export to GitHub Pages"
status: "✅ COMPLETED - October 7, 2025"

---

## Goal

**Feature Goal**: Build a fully functional, production-ready marketing website homepage with a custom design system that showcases AR Automation's services across three verticals (Accounting, E-commerce, Education) with trust indicators and compelling CTAs.

**Deliverable**:
- ✅ Complete design system configured in Tailwind CSS with AR Automation brand colors
- ✅ Reusable component library (Button, Card, Section)
- ✅ Fully responsive homepage with 7 sections (Navigation, Hero, Verticals, Solutions, Trust Indicators, CTA, Footer)
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment configured with automated CI/CD

**Why**:
- As a newly formulated AI agency, we need a portal whereby our new potential customers can get in contact with us that also serves as a live demonstration of the type of skills we have.
- So we want something that demonstrates our technological capabilities as well as our ability to think in a clear, logical, and structured manner.
- The why of this initial stage is to create a base structure where our AI technologies can sit and become almost immediately interactive for anybody visiting our website. By demonstrating the power and usefulness to any business of using a truly AI-first approach. 


## Why

- **Business value**: Establishes online presence for AR Automation, generates qualified leads from three target verticals
- **Integration**: Foundation for all future pages (industry pages, team, contact, blog)
- **Problems solved**:
  - No web presence → Professional marketing website
  - Generic messaging → Vertical-specific value propositions
  - Unclear ROI → Trust indicators showing 20-30 hours saved per week, 66% productivity gains
  - For whom: Mid-sized organizations seeking AI automation solutions ($200K-$2M engagement value)

## What

A production-ready marketing website homepage with:

### Design System
- Tailwind CSS extended with AR Automation brand colors
- Typography system (system fonts for performance)
- Spacing system (8px base unit)
- Component library (Button, Card, Section)

### Technical Implementation
- Next.js 15 App Router with Server Components
- Static export configured for GitHub Pages
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Semantic HTML with accessibility

### Homepage Sections (English only, following KISS/YAGNI principles)
1. **Navigation**: Logo, menu items (Industries dropdown, Team, Resources), language switcher placeholder, "Get in Touch" CTA
2. **Hero Section**: Value proposition headline, subheadline, primary CTA ("Schedule Free Audit"), secondary CTA ("See How It Works")
3. **Three Verticals**: Grid of 3 cards (Accounting, E-commerce, Education) with pain points, results, CTAs
4. **General conversion bot**: "What do you want to automate?" -> Chatbot that engages and converts potential clients.
5. **Solutions Overview**: 4 main solutions with alternating image/text layout
6. **Trust Indicators**: Animated stat counters, client logos, certifications, case study highlights
7. **CTA Section**: Final conversion section with risk reversal
8. **Footer**: Multi-column links, social media, copyright


### Success Criteria

- [x] Design system complete with all AR Automation brand colors in Tailwind config
- [x] Base component library (Button, Card, Section) implemented and tested
- [x] All 7 homepage sections built and responsive
- [⏳] Lighthouse score 95+ (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO) - Ready for testing post-deployment
- [⏳] Page load time < 2 seconds - Ready for testing post-deployment
- [x] No TypeScript errors (0 errors)
- [x] No ESLint warnings/errors (0 warnings/errors)
- [x] Mobile navigation works smoothly (Client Component with hamburger menu)
- [x] All links and CTAs are functional (placeholder anchors ready for future pages)
- [⏳] Deployed successfully to GitHub Pages - Workflow created, awaiting git push
- [⏳] GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully - Workflow file created and validated
- [x] All components follow established patterns and are reusable
- [x] AI development workflow clearly established and documented

**Note**: Items marked [⏳] are ready but require deployment to GitHub Pages to complete. 


## User Personas

**Target User**: Potential B2B clients from three verticals (or other) visiting the AR Automation website for the first time

**Use Case**: Decision-makers (Operations Directors, E-commerce Directors, University Registrars, others) researching automation solutions land on the homepage to evaluate AR Automation's credibility and service offerings

**User Journey**:
1. User arrives at homepage (from Google search, referral, or direct)
2. Sees compelling hero message with clear value proposition
3. Scans three vertical cards to find their industry
4. Reviews solutions overview and trust indicators
5. Enter into a sales conversion conversation with one of our sales chatbots that gathers users' contact information and intensifies their potential current need for AI solutions (At this stage, these components will simply be placeholders, but later on we will develop the actual AI applications.)

**Pain Points Addressed**:
- Unclear automation vendor credibility → Trust indicators and proven results
- Generic "one-size-fits-all" solutions → Vertical-specific messaging
- Difficult to understand what services are offered → Clear solutions overview
- Chatbots should be able to emphathize with current problems, categorize likely potential solutions, and gather information on what kind of solution the client would ideally have.  -> should collect all information we need to sell to them!
- Mobile-unfriendly websites → Fully responsive design

### Documentation & References

```yaml
# Next.js 15 App Router - MUST READ
- url: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports
  why: Static export configuration for GitHub Pages deployment
  critical: |
    - Use output: 'export' in next.config.js
    - Set images.unoptimized: true for static export
    - All components default to Server Components
    - No API routes or server actions in static export
    - Only GET route handlers supported

- url: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components
  why: Understanding when to use Server vs Client Components
  critical: |
    - Default: All components are Server Components
    - Use 'use client' directive only when you need:
      * State (useState, useReducer)
      * Event handlers (onClick, onChange)
      * Browser APIs (window, localStorage)
      * useEffect, custom hooks
    - Push Client Components to leaf nodes for better performance
    - Server Components reduce JavaScript bundle size

- url: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/metadata-and-og-images
  why: SEO metadata configuration in App Router
  critical: |
    - Export 'metadata' object from layout.tsx or page.tsx
    - Metadata only supported in Server Components
    - Use generateMetadata for dynamic metadata
    - Root layout defines base metadata merged with child segments

# Tailwind CSS 3.4 - MUST READ
- url: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme
  why: Extending Tailwind theme with custom brand colors
  critical: |
    - Use theme.extend.colors to add brand colors without removing defaults
    - Color naming: Use semantic names (primary-dark, primary-light, accent-red)
    - Can also define colors with nested objects for shades
    - Colors accessible via className utilities (bg-primary-dark, text-accent-red)

- url: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles
  why: Best practices for custom styling in Tailwind
  critical: |
    - Prefer utility classes over @apply
    - Use @layer utilities for custom utilities
    - Extract repeated patterns into components, not @apply rules
    - Keep styles maintainable and searchable

# Brand Story & Marketing Copy - MUST READ
- file: .claude/artifacts/AR-Automation-Overview.md
  why: Executive summary, core services, value propositions, and target markets
  critical: |
    - Use this for understanding AR Automation's positioning and services
    - Core services section defines the 5 main solutions (Intelligent Process Automation, AI Knowledge Systems, etc.)
    - Target markets section explains the three verticals (Accounting, E-commerce, Education)
    - Contains real business metrics and value propositions to use in copy

- file: .claude/artifacts/create_brand_story/accounting-automation-landing-page-copy.md
  why: Ready-to-use hero headlines, pain points, and solutions for Accounting vertical
  section: Hero Section, Problem Section, Solution Section
  critical: |
    - Hero headline: "Stop Drowning in Manual Work. Start Delivering Strategic Advice."
    - Specific pain points: "Your staff wastes 5+ hours weekly", "Your best people are leaving"
    - Use this exact copy or adapt it for the Accounting vertical card
    - Contains CTA copy: "Schedule Your Free Automation Audit"

- file: .claude/artifacts/create_brand_story/ecommerce-marketing-copy.md
  why: Ready-to-use marketing copy for E-commerce vertical
  critical: |
    - Use for E-commerce vertical card content
    - Contains specific pain points and solutions for e-commerce businesses
    - Brand voice and messaging examples

- file: .claude/artifacts/create_brand_story/educational_institutions_landing_page.md
  why: Ready-to-use landing page copy for Educational institutions vertical
  critical: |
    - Use for Education vertical card content
    - Contains specific pain points and solutions for universities/schools
    - Multilingual support emphasis, student registration pain points

- file: .claude/artifacts/create_brand_story/accounting-automation-brand-script.md
  why: Brand script with character, problem, guide, plan structure for Accounting
  pattern: StoryBrand framework - Hero (customer), Problem, Guide (AR Automation), Plan, Call to Action
  gotcha: Use this for understanding the narrative structure, not just copying text

- file: .claude/artifacts/create_brand_story/ecommerce-brandscript.md
  why: Brand script for E-commerce vertical
  pattern: StoryBrand framework structure

- file: .claude/artifacts/create_brand_story/educational_institutions_brandscript.md
  why: Brand script for Educational institutions vertical
  pattern: StoryBrand framework structure

# GitHub Pages Deployment - MUST READ
- url: https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-github-pages
  why: Complete working example of Next.js + GitHub Pages deployment
  pattern: GitHub Actions workflow structure and repository configuration
  gotcha: |
    - Requires .nojekyll file in /public directory
    - basePath must match repository name
    - In Settings → Pages, set Source to "GitHub Actions"
    - Use only 'next build' command, not 'next export'

- file: /Users/richardthompson/CODE/ARAutomationWebsite2/next.config.js
  why: Existing static export configuration pattern
  pattern: |
    - Conditional basePath/assetPrefix based on NODE_ENV
    - output: 'export' for static generation
    - images.unoptimized: true required
  gotcha: basePath only applies in production, not development

- file: /Users/richardthompson/CODE/ARAutomationWebsite2/app/page.tsx

  why: Root layout pattern for metadata and HTML structure
  pattern: Simple RootLayout with metadata export
  gotcha: This is a Server Component - no 'use client' needed

- file: /Users/richardthompson/CODE/ARAutomationWebsite2/app/globals.css
  why: Global styles and Tailwind directives
  pattern: Tailwind @layer imports and CSS custom properties
  gotcha: Use CSS variables for colors that can be referenced in Tailwind config

- file: /Users/richardthompson/CODE/ARAutomationWebsite2/tailwind.config.ts
  why: Existing Tailwind configuration to extend
  pattern: Content paths for purging, theme extension
  gotcha: Must update with brand colors in theme.extend.colors

- file: /Users/richardthompson/CODE/ARAutomationWebsite2/CLAUDE.md
  why: Project development philosophy and guidelines
  critical: |
    - KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid
    - YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It - build features only when needed
    - Progressive Enhancement: Start simple, add complexity when required
    - Component size: Keep under 200 lines per component
    - Use Tailwind utility classes, not complex abstractions

- docfile: PRPs/ar-automation-website-prd.md
  why: Complete product requirements with design system, color palette, and section specifications
  section: |
    - Section 3: Design System & Brand (colors, typography, spacing, components)
    - Section 5: Page Specifications (homepage sections with detailed specs)
    - Section 9: Implementation Phases (Week 1-2 scope)

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Next.js 15 App Router with Static Export

// 1. All components default to Server Components
// ✅ Good - Server Component (default)
export default function HeroSection() {
  return <section>...</section>;
}

// ❌ Bad - Unnecessary 'use client' for static content
'use client';
export default function HeroSection() {
  return <section>...</section>;
}

// ✅ Good - Client Component only when needed
'use client';
export default function MobileMenu() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false); // Needs state
  return ...;
}

// 2. Static Export Limitations
// ❌ Cannot use: API routes, Server Actions, dynamic routes with getStaticPaths
// ✅ Can use: Server Components, Client Components, Route Handlers with GET

// 3. Tailwind CSS Class Naming
// ✅ Good - Clear, readable utility classes
<button className="px-6 py-3 bg-primary-dark text-white rounded-md hover:bg-opacity-90 transition-colors">
  Click Me
</button>

// ❌ Bad - Overly complex class strings (extract to component instead)
<button className="px-6 py-3 bg-gradient-to-r from-primary-dark via-primary-light to-accent-red text-white rounded-md hover:shadow-2xl hover:scale-105 transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out transform ...">

// 4. TypeScript with Next.js
// ✅ Good - Simple, clear prop interfaces
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'text';
}

// ❌ Bad - Over-engineered types
type ButtonVariant = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'text';
type ButtonSize = 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
type ButtonProps<T extends ButtonVariant = 'primary'> = ...;

// 5. Metadata in App Router
// ✅ Good - Static metadata in Server Component
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'AR Automation',
  description: 'Streamlining your business processes',
};

// ❌ Bad - Trying to use metadata in Client Component (won't work)
'use client';
export const metadata = {...}; // This will be ignored!

// 6. GitHub Pages basePath
// The basePath is '/ARAutomationWebsite2' in production
// ✅ Good - Next.js handles this automatically for links
<Link href="/about">About</Link> // Becomes /ARAutomationWebsite2/about in production

// ❌ Bad - Hardcoding basePath
<Link href="/ARAutomationWebsite2/about">About</Link> // Will break in development

// 7. Images in Static Export
// ✅ Good - unoptimized: true is set in next.config.js
// Can use regular img tags or next/image (unoptimized)
<img src="/logo.png" alt="Logo" /> // Works fine

// 8. Component Organization
// ✅ Good - Feature-based organization
components/navigation/Navigation.tsx
components/hero/HeroSection.tsx

// ❌ Avoid - Deep nesting for simple components
components/sections/homepage/hero/components/HeroSection.tsx
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Data Models and Structure

```typescript
// No complex data models needed for Phase 1
// Just prop interfaces for components

// components/shared/Button.tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'text';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  fullWidth?: boolean;
  className?: string;
}

// components/shared/Card.tsx
interface CardProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  variant?: 'default' | 'hover' | 'flat';
  className?: string;
}

// components/verticals/VerticalCard.tsx
interface VerticalCardProps {
  id: 'accounting' | 'ecommerce' | 'education';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  painPoints: string[];
  results: string[];
  ctaLabel: string;
  ctaLink: string;
}

// app/layout.tsx - Enhanced Metadata
interface Metadata {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  keywords?: string;
  openGraph?: {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    type: string;
    images: string[];
  };
}
```

// Each component should be under 200 lines
// If a component gets large, split it into smaller pieces
// Follow KISS principle - simple solutions over complex ones
```

### Integration Points

```yaml
CONFIGURATION:
  - file: tailwind.config.ts
    action: Extend theme.extend.colors with brand colors
    pattern: "colors: { primary: { dark: '...', light: '...' }, ... }"

  - file: app/globals.css
    action: Add CSS custom properties for brand colors
    pattern: "--color-primary-dark: #003049; ..."

  - file: app/layout.tsx
    action: Enhance metadata object with comprehensive SEO
    pattern: "metadata: { title, description, keywords, openGraph }"

DEPLOYMENT:
  - file: .github/workflows/deploy.yml
    action: Create GitHub Actions workflow
    pattern: "on: push, jobs: build & deploy"
    critical: Use actions/checkout@v4, setup-node@v4, upload-pages-artifact@v3

  - file: public/.nojekyll
    action: Verify exists (should already be there)
    why: Prevents GitHub Pages Jekyll processing

  - settings: GitHub repository → Settings → Pages
    action: Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
    critical: Must not be set to branch deployment

COMPONENTS:
  - pattern: All new components go in /components directory
    organization: Feature-based folders (navigation/, hero/, verticals/, etc.)

  - imports: Use @/ alias for imports
    example: "import { Button } from '@/components/shared/Button';"

  - component type: Default to Server Components
    exception: Only use 'use client' for MobileMenu (needs state)
```

# If failed (red X), click to see logs and fix errors

# 2. Verify GitHub Pages settings
# Go to Settings → Pages
# Should show: "Your site is live at https://USERNAME.github.io/ARAutomationWebsite2"

# 3. Visit deployed site
# https://USERNAME.github.io/ARAutomationWebsite2
# Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username

# 4. Test on deployed site:
# - Homepage loads correctly
# - All sections render
# - Images load (check browser console for 404s)
# - Styles applied correctly
# - Links work
# - Mobile responsive (test on real mobile device if possible)
# - Fast load time (< 2 seconds)

# 5. Test on multiple devices/browsers:

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Component Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Don't create deeply nested component folders for simple components
  - Bad: `components/sections/homepage/hero/components/HeroSection.tsx`
  - Good: `components/hero/HeroSection.tsx`

- ❌ Don't add 'use client' to Server Components unnecessarily
  - Bad: Every component has 'use client' directive
  - Good: Only MobileMenu has 'use client' (needs useState)

- ❌ Don't over-engineer TypeScript types
  - Bad: Complex generic types, branded types, advanced mapped types
  - Good: Simple interfaces with clear prop types

- ❌ Don't create abstract base classes or complex inheritance
  - Bad: `BaseComponent` class that all components extend
  - Good: Simple functional components with composition

### Styling Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Don't use inline styles or styled-components
  - Bad: `<div style={{ padding: '20px', color: '#003049' }}>`
  - Good: `<div className="p-5 text-primary-dark">`

- ❌ Don't use @apply excessively in CSS
  - Bad: Creating @apply rules for every component
  - Good: Use Tailwind utility classes directly in JSX

- ❌ Don't hardcode colors in components
  - Bad: `className="bg-[#003049]"`
  - Good: `className="bg-primary-dark"`

- ❌ Don't create overly long className strings
  - Bad: 20+ utility classes on a single element
  - Good: Extract to a reusable component if > 10 classes

### Code Organization Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Don't put all components in a single file
  - Bad: 500-line app/page.tsx with all sections inline
  - Good: Separate files for each section/component

- ❌ Don't mix concerns in components
  - Bad: Navigation component that also handles routing logic and data fetching
  - Good: Navigation component that only renders UI

- ❌ Don't create premature abstractions
  - Bad: Creating a "BaseCard" and "BaseButton" factory pattern before you need it
  - Good: Create simple components, extract patterns when you see repetition (3+ times)

### Next.js Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Don't use Pages Router patterns in App Router
  - Bad: Trying to use getStaticProps in app/page.tsx
  - Good: Use Server Components for data fetching (or hardcode for Phase 1)

- ❌ Don't forget basePath when testing production build locally
  - Bad: Visiting `http://localhost:3000` after `npx serve out`
  - Good: Visiting `http://localhost:3000/ARAutomationWebsite2`

- ❌ Don't use API routes with static export
  - Bad: Creating app/api/contact/route.ts (won't work with output: 'export')
  - Good: Use external form service or plan for Phase 3

### Development Workflow Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Don't skip validation steps
  - Bad: Pushing to GitHub without running `npm run build` locally
  - Good: Test production build locally first

- ❌ Don't ignore TypeScript errors with @ts-ignore everywhere
  - Bad: Adding @ts-ignore to suppress valid type errors
  - Good: Fix the underlying type issue

- ❌ Don't commit broken code
  - Bad: "Will fix later" commits that break the build
  - Good: Ensure `npm run build` succeeds before committing

- ❌ Don't add dependencies without thinking
  - Bad: npm install <random-package> for every small feature
  - Good: Use built-in solutions first, add dependencies only when clearly needed (YAGNI)
