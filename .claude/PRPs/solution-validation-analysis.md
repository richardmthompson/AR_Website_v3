- Lack of standardization across credential frameworks
- Employer adoption and recognition of alternative credentials
- Quality assurance and accreditation frameworks
- 46% of employers question credential quality
- 33% question alignment with occupational standards

**Operational Bottlenecks (CAN be automated):**
- Manual credential issuance workflows (takes days/weeks)
- Data integration between credential platforms and employer HR systems
- Verification workflows for employers
- Skills mapping across different frameworks
- Credential portability and cross-platform exchange

#### Can We Actually Help?
**YES - Strong Alignment** ✅

**What We Solve:**
- Automate credential issuance workflow (application → assessment → issuance)
- Build integration pipelines between micro-credential platforms and employer systems
- Verification API for employers to check credential authenticity
- Automated skills taxonomy mapping and cross-walking
- Batch issuance for cohorts

**What We DON'T Solve:**
- Creating the standards themselves
