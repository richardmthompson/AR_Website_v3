  - Limited color palette (2-4 colors)
  - Icon-based components
  - Focus on data flow, not visual realism
- **Best For**: High-level strategic overviews, executive presentations
- **Pros**: Clean, easy to understand, scales well
- **Cons**: May feel too simplified for technical audiences

**Technical/Detailed:**
- **Examples**: AWS, Azure, Datadog
- **Characteristics**:
  - Specific product/service icons
  - Detailed component labels
  - Network boundaries and zones
  - Technical specifications included
- **Best For**: Implementation planning, technical documentation
- **Pros**: Provides implementation-ready detail
- **Cons**: Can overwhelm non-technical audiences

**Hybrid Approach:**
- **Examples**: Salesforce, Twilio
- **Characteristics**:
  - Multiple diagram levels (1-4)
  - Start simple, allow drill-down
  - Context diagrams + detail diagrams
  - Consistent visual language across levels
- **Best For**: Multi-audience documentation
- **Pros**: Serves both strategic and tactical needs
- **Cons**: Requires more design work to maintain consistency

**Recommended for AR Automation:**
Use **Hybrid Approach** with three levels:
1. **Level 1 (Strategic)**: Business process flow with minimal technical detail
2. **Level 2 (Tactical)**: System components and integrations
3. **Level 3 (Technical)**: API calls, data transformations, error handling

---

### 5.2 Color & Visual Hierarchy

**Common Patterns:**
- **Primary color**: Brand color for main components/CTAs

- **Azure**: Blue (Microsoft brand) + Green (positive outcomes) + Orange (warnings)

**Best Practices:**
- Consistent color meaning across all diagrams
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
- Colorblind-friendly palette
- Use color + icons/patterns (don't rely on color alone)

**Recommended for AR Automation:**
```
- Primary Blue (#0066CC): AR Automation components, data flow
- Accent Green (#00AA55): Successful automations, savings
- External Gray (#6B7280): Third-party integrations

## Automated Invoice Processing

### The Challenge
Accounting firms process hundreds of invoices monthly. Manual data entry is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. Staff spend 40% of their time on repetitive data entry instead of high-value advisory work.

### The Solution
Our Automated Invoice Processing pattern uses AI-powered OCR and smart routing to extract invoice data, validate against purchase orders, route for approval, and post to your accounting system—automatically.

### How It Works
[Interactive diagram or step-by-step visual]
1. Invoice arrives via email or upload
2. AI extracts data (vendor, amount, date, line items)
3. System validates against purchase order
4. Workflow routes for approval if needed
5. Approved invoices post to accounting system
6. Confirmation sent to all parties

### Benefits
- **90% reduction** in manual data entry time
- **99.8% accuracy** in data extraction
- **50% faster** invoice processing time
- **$30,000+ annual savings** for typical mid-size firm

### Implementation Options
[Comparison table of implementation approaches]

### Technical Architecture
[Expandable accordion with detailed diagram]

### Getting Started
[CTA buttons: "Schedule Demo" | "Download Technical Specs"]

## Conclusion

The most successful technical architecture presentations share common traits:

1. **Start Simple, Go Deep**: Progressive disclosure allows users to engage at their appropriate level
2. **Visual-First**: Diagrams communicate faster than text
3. **Problem-Oriented**: Organize by what users want to accomplish, not technical features
4. **Multi-Audience**: Balance executive, managerial, and technical perspectives
5. **Interactive**: Let users filter, compare, and explore
6. **Credible**: Use customer stories, metrics, and expert validation
7. **Actionable**: Clear next steps and downloadable resources

For AR Automation's 4 architecture patterns, implementing these best practices will:
- Help prospects self-identify the right pattern
- Build confidence through technical transparency
- Reduce sales cycle by educating buyers
- Enable technical evaluation without heavy sales involvement
- Differentiate through architectural expertise

The recommended approach combines the visual simplicity of Segment, the technical depth of AWS/Azure, the decision frameworks of Stripe, and the interactive exploration of Ilograph—all tailored to AR Automation's specific industries and use cases.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and prioritize recommendations
2. Create wireframes for pattern landing page
3. Design Level 1 diagrams for each pattern
4. Develop content for first pattern as template
5. Build interactive pattern selector MVP

**Questions to Address:**
- Which of the 4 patterns should be featured first?
- What are the exact names of the 4 patterns?
- Which integrations are most important to showcase?
- Do we have customer success stories with metrics?
- What's the target audience priority (executives vs. technical)?
