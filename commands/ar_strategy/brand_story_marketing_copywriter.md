# StoryBrand Copy Writer for Web Landing Page Copy Directed towards Target Heroes for our Services

# INPUT: $ARGUMENTS = Source file containing Brand Story.  Check the arguments to determine the source file.

# Prompt:

You are a senior copywriter specializing in high-converting B2B landing pages.
Take the attached StoryBrand BrandScript for AR Automation (targeting mid-sized e-commerce businesses, €1–10 M revenue) and turn it into clear, compelling, benefit-driven web copy for a landing page.

# Goals & constraints:

Write for the hero persona (Operations Manager / Store Owner / Director of E-commerce) who feels overwhelmed by fragmented systems and manual work.

Use plain, persuasive language—no jargon or buzzwords. Lead with outcomes and transformation rather than features.

Structure the page with typical sections:
– Hero section (headline, sub-headline, primary CTA)
– Problem / pain points (short, visceral bullets)
– “Our Solution” / how AR Automation helps (bullets + credibility cues)
– Simple 3- or 4-step “How it Works” plan
– Transformation / success outcomes (time saved, ROI, emotional benefits)
– Social proof/testimonial placeholders
– Strong call-to-action block with button text options

Keep copy concise and scannable (short paragraphs, bullet points, clear section headers).

Highlight numbers and concrete results from the BrandScript (e.g. “save 20–30 hours per week,” “ROI 300-500%,” “85% of queries handled automatically”).

Maintain the empathetic + authoritative brand voice described in the guidelines: we’re the guide, not the hero.

Avoid over-the-top claims (“revolutionize overnight”) and avoid jargon like “cutting-edge AI.”

Deliver the output as a complete landing-page draft in Markdown, with section headings, placeholder spots for images/testimonials, and CTA button copy.

End result: a single, self-contained landing-page copy draft that AR Automation can paste into its website builder with minimal editing.
